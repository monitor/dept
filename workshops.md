<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> is moving and developing through a series of iterations, where, slowly, it looks for improving its methodology and its techniques. Refining them is like to engage in crash tests, deliberately accepting that an open laboratory, its experiments, might either succeed or fail. For this reason, the different iterations, taking place in different cities, are built progressively.

As for today, five iterations are planned, and if you are willing to collaborate to set up an iteration, just feel free to [drop us a message](mailto:donato.ricci@sciencespo.fr).
