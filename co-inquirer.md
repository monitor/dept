<h2>Become a co-inquirer</h2>
<span class="dept">DEPT.</span>'s research protocol is nourished and supported by the active collaboration of local communities, people and associations with which it collaborates. Trying to avoid as much as possible the adoption of a methodology imposed from above — disconnected from its territory of investigation, standardized and homogenized by the need to pursue exhaustiveness, representativeness and comparability of results — <span class="dept">DEPT.</span> offers itself as an open and participatory laboratory.

There are many possibilities for collaboration. You can [register](/workshops) for one or more work sessions and of one or multiple roles:
* **be part of a dialogue**: come to explore, annotate, make a critique of our catalogues and through them discuss your personal experiences.
* **lead a dialogue**: please join to discuss with other participants, asking questions and listening to their stories. This is a little bit more engaging role. You will take some notes of the discussions and transcribe them in an ad-hoc designed tool. Do not worry about using english as the language of dialogues. We really would like the exchange to take place in your native language and not to have the overall experience being over formatted by the adoption of global idioms.
* **write the final partition of our collective experiment**: feel free to contribute in discuss, select, further explore and re-assemble the narrative coming from the individual dialogues. We would like to work with you in a collective writing experiment incorporating different and multiple point of views.
* **read and perform the final text**: jump in if you feel comfortable with reading and performing the results of the workshop and of the specific iteration. Obviously, besides experienced or amateur actors and performers, we would be more than glad to collaborate with anybody wishing to embody a collective voice.

...or just stop by to say hello or have coffee together.
