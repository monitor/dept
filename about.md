<h2>What if we hold on a moment to see what's around us?</h2>

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> is a participative research project aimed at describing the present conditions of the environments we inhabit. It unfolds as a protocol for attention.

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> aligns in a series of itinerant Public Workshops a set of practices and techniques, coming from Digital Social Science, Design Research and Performative Arts.

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> looks for new public modes of narration, interpretation and representation of ordinary objects.

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> looks after a sensitivity to the ways these objects circulate around us and to the way we circulated around them.

<br>
The five relational dimensions we will observe and describe are:

OUT THERE, exploring the invitations to act in the public space by signs;<br>
IN HERE, engaging in the rituals of domestic spaces through the stories of their objects;<br>
HEREUNDER, digging into the emotional responses to the city most unwanted beings;<br>
UP HERE, probing the subtle landscape of human dreams and hopes;<br>
IN BETWEEN, seeking for new transitive exchanges with cultural institutions.<br>
<br>
<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> asks its participants, its co-inquirers, to re-ground themselves into their own “now” as a response to a progressive saturation of the projections of and towards the “future”. It questions the way we make our present reality being represented to eventually engage in transformational future commitments. It operates on the current states of the individual and collective life, in the very moment where expectations and memories are activated as transitions and transactions.
<br>

<h2>What if we look for a common voice to express it?</h2>
For each dimension of the inquiry, we aim at identifying and accounting for elements and fragments—virtual, material, and symbolic elements—that provide dependencies and subsistence to ourselves, as individuals and as heterogeneous unstable collectives. Our descriptions are based on an experimental triangulation of different research methods and practices. Their progressive articulation offers a scheme for studying, understanding and, above all, building up a new sensitivity to the present. Each approach offers a distinct empirical capacity and a specific publication format. Each format is meant to re-mediate the other ones and progressively engage in grounded confrontation with the co-inquirers. Firstly through individual discussions and, then as a collective voice.

**Re-composing digital traces**<br>
Repurposing techniques issued by Digital Social Sciences, we are producing for each dimension a preliminary study. We collect and systematise traces and pieces of evidence of its composition—data and information coming from social networks, digital platforms and archives—organising them into a series of printed catalogues to be offered to public scrutiny.

**Writing individual narratives**<br>
Tweaking approaches rooted in Communication and Participation Design, we mobilise the catalogues to invite the participants to situate themselves into the inquired dimension. The co-inquirers take part in exercises for understanding what has been taken into account, what needs to be added and what should be excluded from the catalogues. The resulting narratives are inscribed into a series of posters mixing images and texts.

**Performing a collective voice**<br>
Tuning the Arts of the Theatre we collectively rewrite and perform the narratives by cutting, splicing, regenerating them in a partition generating processes of performative expressions. Capturing and recording them in audio tracks, we aim at withdrawing ourself from the hegemony of the visual. As a sort of resetting procedure, an interpretative modality calibrated to the uniques features of each dimension, we are trying to make ourself heard in our present reality.

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> explores how the performing arts, social sciences and design practices can otherwise express the objects and the subjects composing contemporary issues. On this view, the inquiry is not meant to passively observe our present realities. On the contrary, it proposes an active process which starts with a call to hold on and then proceeds towards active manipulations and forms of expressions. It proposes to establish new roles, emotional feelings and political responsibilities.

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> is based on a multiplicity of national and international, artistic and academic experiences, in which the core team has been involved for more than 5 years.

[Donato Ricci](http://bit.ly/do_does_this), [médialab SciencesPo](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/) , Researcher. He is working on the hybridization between Design and Digital Social Sciences research methods. He is interested in the "materialization of data" in public and participatory situations to produce localized and situated readings.

Duncan Evennou, Lighthouse Company, actor, director. He develops works at the fringes of contemporary art, sociology and performance around three major dynamics: creation, research and pedagogy. His shows reflect a willingness to work on the question of the contemporary.
