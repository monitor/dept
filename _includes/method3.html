  <p><span class="dept">DEPT.</span> continues through the voice of the co-inquirers. Tuning the Arts of the Theatre it rewrites and performs the narratives by cutting, splicing, regenerating them into a partition. Capturing and recording these partitions in <a href="/dept-repository/">audio track</a>, delivers a calibrated account of the local features of each dimension and , at once, of the overall experience. <br>
The third movement invites the <a href="/become-a-co-inquirer/">co-inquirers</a> to negotiate the personal narratives and to assemble them in a public expression. This delicate operation is aimed at creating a partition where it could be felt the alignment of various individual experiences and, at the same time, the moments and the reasons for their possible divergences. The co-inquirers discuss collectively the most relevant, peculiar, striking or representative fragments coming from the individual narratives. Looking for rhythms and directions, the scope is to produce a voice standing for the localised understanding of the dimension under inquiry. <br>
As a final moment a debriefing session, more than focus on the technicalities, will strive to engage in discussions about the problem of the representation asking ourselves if we feel adequately represented by this voice. If we feel betrayed by it. If we should adhere or not.
