<h2>A common approach to explore five dimensions of the ordinary.</h2>

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> offers a participatory, performative and iterative methodology. Set-up in five [European cities](/workshops), it proposes a research methods meant to gather, re-narrate and voice the links and dependencies we are sustained by in our everyday lives. The approach has the scope to questions these links, letting some of them be composed or decomposed; weighted and ordered; supplemented or deformed. Concerned with the active and laborious process of descriptive adjustments—done by the identification, grouping and the reconnection of heterogeneous objects and entities—it [invites to participate](/become-a-co-inquirer/) in the inquiry in all its phases, from the data collection to the experimentations with material and publishing forms till the production of a performative piece, to gather differently together.
<br/><br/>
Adapting the protocols accordingly to the different local realities, the research procedure follows three common movements:

## Re-composing digital traces
{% include slider-methods-1.html %}
<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> starts with a preliminary investigation based on digital or digitised data, producing original corpora and publishing them into original [catalogues](/dept-repository).<br>
The first movement harvests a vast array of heterogeneous elements for describing each dimension of the inquiry. For each of the five dimensions of the inquiry, a specific social network, a digital platform or archive has been identified to serve for such scope.
The data collection whether addressing images, texts or sound is carried out in the months preceding the workshops. The acquisition protocols is shared with the first group of [co-inquirers](/become-a-co-inquirer/) creating the possibility of receiving contributions from local communities since the beginning of the research process.<br>
The conclusion of the first movement triggers a specific, open, design-led inquiry, dedicated to the radical problematization of the catalogues. It is achieved with situated and constructive re-descriptions and re-interpretations.

## Writing individual narratives
<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> proceeds by involving local communities through participative exercises, collecting individual narratives and transcribing them in a set of posters.
The second movement encourage the co-inquirers to situate themselves inside the dimension under inquiry. The catalogues are used as baseline descriptions open to questions and critiques, as triggers for situated and grounded conversation. We aim at collecting expressions of feelings, emotions, relations, links, dependencies towards the previously collected and systematised elements through discursive exercise, looking for hesitations and attentional commitment. The conversations transcriptions, becoming manifestations of personal narratives, are collected and distilled into textual and visual posters.<br>
The conversations, led in the language of the place where the workshop occurs, are conducted by the participants themselves, thus becoming co-inquirers. The workshops become a fully open, horizontal and participative laboratory.<br>
The conclusion of the second movement starts with the negotiations of personal narratives. More than just ensuring a smooth unification of individual accounts into greater arguments, the scope is to conjoin them as an expression of a collective experience respecting both convergences and divergences, both harmonies and dissonances.

## Performing a collective voice
<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> continues through the voice of some performers reading, conveying and enacting the collective emerging from the overall experience and captured by an [audio-track](/dept-repository).<br>
The third movement invites the [co-inquirers](/become-a-co-inquirer/) in negotiating the personal narratives and assembles them in the form of a public performance. This delicate operation is aimed at creating a partition and a score where it could be felt the alignment of the various individual experiences and, at once, the moment and the reasons for possible bifurcations.
The co-inquirers discuss collectively the fragments and the passages that are most relevant, peculiar, striking or representative of the collective assembled and participating in the workshop. By interacting or by listening to the discussions, one of the main tasks is to grasp the elements of language, tones of voice and shades of interactions to be re-expressed them in the final performance. Looking for rhythms and directions, the scope is to produce a voice standing for the localised understanding of the dimension under inquiry. The partition and the score constitute another public outcome, activated by the voice and the body of the co-inquirers and recorded with specific devices.<br>
As a final moment a debriefing session, more than focus on the technicalities, will strive to engage in discussions about the problem of the representation asking ourselves if we feel adequately represented by this voice. If we feel betrayed by it. If we should adhere or not.
