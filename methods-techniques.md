<h2>Methods & Techniques</h2>

<span class="dept">DEPT.</span> offers a participatory, performative and iterative methodology. Set-up in [five European cities](/workshops/), it proposes a research method meant to gather, re-narrate and voice the links and dependencies we are sustained in our everyday lives. The approach has the scope to questions these links, letting some of them be composed or decomposed; weighted and ordered; supplemented or deformed. Concerned with the active and laborious process of descriptive adjustments — done by the identification, grouping and the reconnection of heterogeneous objects and entities — it [invites to participate in the inquiry](/become-a-co-inquirer/) from data collection to experimentations with publishing and performative formats.

Adapting the protocols accordingly to the different local realities, the research procedure follows three common movements:
